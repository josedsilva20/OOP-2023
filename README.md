# OOP-2023

Contains notes from my journey trough the subject.

The exercises from the lab classes can be accessed by [this link](https://fenix.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/disciplinas/PO2/2023-2024/1-semestre/aulas-praticas). To do so, you need to be authenticated to the fenixEdu platform from IST.

## Notes

  The notes are organized in two sections: one for theoritical classes and one for lab classes. The notes from `theoretical classes` can be accessed [here](https://github.com/josedsilva20/OOP-2023/tree/main/Teo%CC%81ricas), and from the `lab classes` [here](https://github.com/josedsilva20/OOP-2023/tree/main/Laborato%CC%81rios).
